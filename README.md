Stablecoin design:

1. Relative Stability: Anchored or pegged: $1.00
   1.1 Chain link price feed
   1.2 Set a function to exchange ETH & BTC: $$$
2. Stability Mechanism (Minting): Algorithmic (Decentralized)
   2.1 People can only mint stablecoin with enough collateral (coded)
3. Collateral: Exogenous (Crypto)
   3.1 wETH
   3.2 wBTC

- Calculate health factor function
- Set health factor if debt is 0
- Added a bunch of view function

1. What are our invariants/properties?

1. Some proper oracle use.
1. Write more tests
1. Smartcontract audit preparation
